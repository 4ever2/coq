- **Changed:**
  the congruence tactic now can handle some dependently typed constructor fields.
  The field's type has to be composed of terms occuring globally or projectable from
  parameters or indices of the inductive type
  (`#19700 <https://github.com/rocq-prover/rocq/pull/19700>`_,
  by Benedict Christian Smit).
