- **Fixed:**
  `multi_match!`, `multi_match! goal` and the underlying
  `Ltac2.Pattern.multi_match0` and `Ltac2.Pattern.multi_goal_match0`
  now preserve exceptions from backtracking after a branch succeeded
  instead of replacing them with `Match_failure`
  (e.g. `multi_match! constr:(tt) with tt => () end; Control.zero Not_found`
  now fails with `Not_found` instead of `Match_failure`)
