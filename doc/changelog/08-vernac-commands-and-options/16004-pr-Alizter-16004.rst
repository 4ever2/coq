- **Changed:**
  `Hint` and :cmd:`Instance` commands with no locality attribute are deprecated.
  Previous versions generated a warning, but this version generates an error by
  default. This includes all `Hint` commands described in :ref:`creating_hints`,
  :cmd:`Hint Rewrite`, and :cmd:`Instance`. As mentioned in the error, please
  add an explicit locality to the hint command. The default was
  #[:attr:`global`], but we recommend using #[:attr:`export`] where possible
