- **Changed:** warning `non-primitive-record` is now in category
  `records` instead of `record`. This was the only use of `record` but
  the plural version is also used by `cannot-define-projection`
  `future-coercion-class-constructor` and
  `future-coercion-class-field`. (`#16989
  <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/16989>`_, by GaÃ«tan Gilbert).
