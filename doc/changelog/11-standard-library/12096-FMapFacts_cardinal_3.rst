- **Added:**
  Lemma `cardinal_Add_In` says that inserting an existing key with a new
  value doesn't change the size of a map, lemma `Add_transpose_neqkey` says
  that unequal keys can be inserted into a map in any order
  (`#12096 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/12096>`_,
  by Isaac van Bakel and Jean-Christophe LÃ©chenet).
