- **Changed:**
  drop the unnecessary second assumption :g:`NoDup l'` from :g:`set_diff_nodup` in ``ListSet.v``,
  with `-compat 8.17` providing the old version of :g:`set_diff_nodup` for compatibility
  (`#16926 <https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/16926>`_,
  by Karl Palmskog with help from Traian Florin Şerbănuţă and Andres Erbsen).
